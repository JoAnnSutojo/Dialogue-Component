            'Wow, how passionately you hate him, Reverend Laurence. Is that enough reason to kill somebody?',
            'What do you mean? He commited suicide. Or do you mean he got murdered. How !!!!????',
            'Yes, he got murdered, and Laurance I think you hated Jimmy and you told me that you wish him to die, where have you been on August the 20th?',
            'First of all, I’m not a killer so be careful of what you say! Second, I was in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria. You could see the pictures I posted on my homepage, and now I have to end this call. Bye!',
            'Sorry, if i bothered you, and I’ll check your homepage, and thank you again for being cooperative.Bye…..'

            "Good day, Mr. Neeson! I’m investigating the murder of Jimmy Brandson and I’d like to ask you a few questions.",
            "Sorry, what did you say?! Jimmy the clown is dead?! How is that possible? He was just here last week. *rubbing his nose*",
            "Yes, that’s why I’m here. Could you please tell me where you were on September 29th?",
            "Let me think… Last Saturday… Ah yes, that weekend my wife took the kids to visit their grandparents for a few days, but I stayed home. *rubbing his nose*",
            "Can anyone confirm that?",
            "Well, I was home alone, but you can ask my wife. I swear I had nothing to do with Jimmy’s death! *rubbing his nose*",
            "Are you sick, Mr. Neeson? Why do you keep rubbing your nose?",
            "Eerrrr.. Huh? What do you mean? Eerrr.. Oh yeah, it’s my allergies. It’s acting up again, you see. Hehe.",
            "Righttt… Ok, listen closely here, pal. I saw your tweets to Jimmy, so I know that you’ve been getting your “allergy medicine” from him. So you better talk! Right now! Or I’m gonna arrest you for drug possession.",
            "What?! How did you..?! Ok, look! I’ve been seeing this girl. Her name’s Buffy. She’s Jimmy’s ex. I think she might know something about the murder. Why don’t you ask her.",
            "You’re not in the position to hide things from me Harry. You're a coke head and you just told me you have a mistress. What will your wife do if she finds out about all this.",
            "Son of a bitch! Fine! She wrote me last Saturday saying that Jimmy texted her out of the blue and asked her to come over.",
            "Did she tell you what he said?",
            "You know what? I’ll show you her texts if you agree to leave me out of it.  *rubbing his nose*",
            "You don't get to bargain here Harry, but If the messages are any good, I’ll think about it.",
            "Ugh! Here! *shows the messages*",
            "Well, that wasn’t so hard, was it Harry? Now tell me where I can find Buffy and I’ll leave you be. For now. Don’t even think of leaving the city!",

            "Hello (username), thanks for accepting my request to meet outside and not in office.",
            "Hi Buffy, don't worry. I don't like the walls either.",
            "Anyway, let's end this investigation quickly, I have an appointment in an hour.",
            "That’s okay! I’ve just a few questions. And let’s call this a meeting instead of an investigation since we are not in an office.",
            "Sounds more suitable..",
            "Well, I’ll start by asking about your relationship to Jimmy. Did you keep in touch with him?",
            "Okay, that sounds painful for me, but no we didn't talk at all after the relationship.",
            "Was it easy for you?",
            "Not at all, I loved him and he was everything to me. But one doesn’t have a choice with cheaters.",
            "Are you sure he cheated on you?",
             "After the relationship ended, there was no reaction from him, but the strange thing is that he tried to repair the relationship after everything that happened and I was entering into a new relationship.",
             "It seems strange, did he know about your new relationship?",
             "He didn’t and I think I should go. Are there many questions left?",
             "No, not many. Can I ask you where you were at the time Jimmy was murdered?",
             "I was arranging some things in my house and, when I got Jimmy's messages, I asked to meet my new boyfriend.",
             "Well, why did you ask to meet your new boyfriend?  And did you tell him about Jimmy's messages?",
             "Yes, I told him because it was strange and I didn't feel comfortable.",
             "Maybe your boyfriend got angry at Jimmy and decided to kill him?",
             "Not at all. He was not angry and tried to calm me down and told me let's meet now and forget about it.",
             "Was the meeting at your boyfriend house?",
             "Yes, I spent the night there, but we didn't talk about Jimmy. He just told me to forget it. I think Jimmy had problems with a drug dealer named Piotr and he owed him a lot of money because of drugs, maybe Piotr killed him.",
             "Who is Piotr? What do you know about him?",
              "Sorry, I have to go. I'm late. But you can find Piotr in Bar 66. That's all I know. I think his name is Piotr Ivanovich.",
              "Thanks, Buffy. In case I have more questions later I will call you.",

            "Well I don’t have to tell you shit, copper. Talk to my lawyer. But, listen, I don’t kill someone who owes me money. I might take a finger or two, sure, but kill? Not until I get my money back. Hahaha… Now get the hell out of my bar and don’t ever show your face around here again!"
